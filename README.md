# hakitool

A search engine aiming at transcripts of [haken dran](https://hakendran.org) podcast.

## Background

In the episode of 2025-06-18 the podcast host Gavin Karlmeier makes a call to develop a search tool for the transcripts of the podcasts.

This repo is an experimental answer to that call. It is based on extracted youtube subtitles and provides a [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)-based web-interface. The tool is currently deployed at [uberspace](https://uberspace.de/).

If you have improvement suggestions, critique, questions, open an issue or contact the author via email (see [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)).
